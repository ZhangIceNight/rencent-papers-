C-Flow-- Conditional Generative Flow Models for Images and 3D Point Clouds

Abstract
Flow-based generative models have highly desirable properties like exact log-likelihood evaluation and exact latent-variable inference, however they are still in their infancy and have not received as much attention as alternative generative models. In this paper, we introduce C-Flow, a novel conditioning scheme that brings normalizing flows to an entirely new scenario with great possibilities for multimodal data modeling. C-Flow is based on a parallel sequence of invertible mappings in which a source flow guides the target flow at every step, enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. We also devise a new strategy to model unordered 3D point clouds that, in combination with the conditioning scheme, makes it possible to address 3D reconstruction from a single image and its inverse problem of rendering an image given a point cloud. We demonstrate our conditioning method to be very  daptable, being also applicable to image manipulation, style transfer and multi-modal image-to-image mapping in a diversity of domains, including RGB images, segmentation maps and edge masks.

基于流的生成模型具有精确的对数似然估计和精确的潜在变量推断等优点，但它们还处于起步阶段，没有受到其他生成模型那样的重视。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新的条件处理方案C-Flow，它将规范化流带到一个全新的场景中，为多模式数据建模提供了极大的可能性。C-Flow基于可逆映射的并行序列，其中源流在每个步骤指导目标流，从而实现对生成过程的细粒度控制。我们还设计了一种新的无序三维点云建模策略，该策略与条件处理方案相结合，可以解决由单个图像进行三维重建及其绘制给定点云图像的反问题。我们证明了我们的调节方法是非常适用的，也适用于图像处理、风格转换和多模式图像到图像的映射，包括RGB图像、分割映射和边缘掩模。
